Linear Regression Analysis on Housing Prices
This project involves analyzing housing prices based on the area of the property. The data used for the analysis is stored in a CSV file named book1.csv.

Tools Used
Python 3.11
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Data
The data used for the analysis consists of two columns: "area" and "price". The "area" column represents the square footage of the property, while the "price" column represents the price of the property in USD.

Analysis
First, we use Seaborn to create a jointplot of the "area" and "price" columns to visualize their relationship. We then use Scikit-learn's linear regression model to fit a line to the data and make predictions.

We start by creating an instance of the linear regression model and fitting it to the "area" and "price" data. We then predict the price of a property with an area of 5000 square feet by passing the value as a 2D array to the predict() method of the model. Finally, we calculate the predicted price by multiplying the slope of the line (stored in the value_m variable) by 5000 and adding the intercept of the line (stored in the value_c variable).

Conclusion
Linear regression analysis is a useful tool for understanding the relationship between two variables and making predictions based on that relationship. In this project, we used linear regression to analyze the relationship between property size and price and make predictions about the price of a property with a given size.
